\title{Complex demodulation}
\usage{
demod(x, dt, w1 = 2 * pi/1, filttype = c("MA"), Nf, nf = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector containing time series observations at constant sampling interval}

\item{dt}{Time step of time series. Arbitrary units. Class \code{Numeric} or \code{difftime}}

\item{w1}{Carrier frequency. Inverse unit of \code{dt}.}

\item{filttype}{Filter type to be applied for low pass filtering. Only "MA" (moving average) is implemented.}

\item{Nf}{Moving average filter width}

\item{nf}{Number of iterative applications of moving average filter. To remove filter bandwidth.}

\item{freq}{Cut-off frequency of Buttersworth filter}
}
